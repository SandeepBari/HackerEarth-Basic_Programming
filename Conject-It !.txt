/*

ou are given a number N. You can perform the following operations on N any number of times:

> If N is even, divide N by 2.

> If N is odd, replace N with 3N+1.

 

Your task is to find out, for a given N, if it is possible to reach the number 1 after performing the above two valid operations on N any number of times.

 

INPUT:

    First-line contains T denoting the number of test cases.
    Next T lines contain just one integer, N.

 

OUTPUT:

Print "YES" (without the quotes) if it is possible to reach 1 for the given N. Else print "NO"(without quotes).

 

Constraints:

1<= T <=100

2<= N <= 10100,000

       
SAMPLE INPUT

1
21

SAMPLE OUTPUT

YES

Explanation

The steps are:

21 --> 64 --> 32 --> 16 --> 8 --> 4 --> 2 --> 1.
Time Limit: 1.0 sec(s) for each input file.
