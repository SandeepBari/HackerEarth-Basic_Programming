    Window Seat : WS
    Middle Seat : MS
    Aisle Seat : AS

You will be given a seat number, find out the seat number facing you and the seat type, i.e. WS, MS or AS.

INPUT
First line of input will consist of a single integer T denoting number of test-cases. Each test-case consists of a single integer N denoting the seat-number.

OUTPUT
For each test case, print the facing seat-number and the seat-type, separated by a single space in a new line.

CONSTRAINTS

    1<=T<=105
    1<=N<=108
